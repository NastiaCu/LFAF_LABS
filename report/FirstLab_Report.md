## Theory
The grammar is a set G which includes Vn, Vt, P and S, where:
* **Vn** is a finite set of nonterminal symbols
* **Vt** is a finite set of terminal symbols
* **S** is a starting point
* **P** is a set of productions 
**For example:**
   ```c#
    P = s{ 
        S → aB
        S → bB
        B → bD
        D → b
        D → aD
        B → cB
        B → aS
    }
   ```
The language generated by the grammar is denoted **L(G)**

Having the following set of productions we can generate different words such as: 
```c#
S → aB → abD → abaD → abaaD → abaab
```` 

## Objectives:

* Understanding of the notion of language
* To study the notion of grammar 
* To study the notion of Finite Automaton
* To implement the classes for Grammar and Finite Automaton
* To write functionality for Production 


## Implementation description

* About 2-3 sentences to explain each piece of the implementation.


* Code snippets from your files.

```
public static void main() 
{

}
```

* If needed, screenshots.
